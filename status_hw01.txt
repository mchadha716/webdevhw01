I thought this assignment was extremely difficult, especially due to
the lack of preparation we had for it. Because of this, I spent over
20 hours working (in a large part unsuccessfully) to create a virtual
machine - which is something that still does not work fully 
successfully for me - and to successfully create my webpage. The lack
of office hours this week, as well as the lack of resources available
made me feel very isolated in completing this assignment and as a 
result I was not able to do as much as I had hoped to. 

And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
